**Movies** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **30** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

*  User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.
*  List item with the [RecyclerView](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView).
*  For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
*  Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
*  Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

*  Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library) for each image during loading.
* Expose details of movie (ratings using RatingBar, popularity, and synopsis) in a separate activity.
The following **bonus** features are implemented:

*  When viewing a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars) the video should show the full backdrop image as the layout.  Uses [Heterogenous RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) to show different layouts.
*  Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/doc/transformations.html)

The following **additional** features are implemented:
Animation CollapsingToolbar
